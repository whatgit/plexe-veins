Plexe-Veins
===========

[Plexe](http://plexe.car2x.org) is an extension of the popular [Veins](http://veins.car2x.org) vehicular network simulator which permits the realistic simulation of platooning (i.e., automated car-following) systems. It features realistic vehicle dynamics and several cruise control models, permitting the analysis of control systems, large-scale and mixed scenario, as well as networking protocols and cooperative maneuvers. It is free to download and easy to extend.

This is the main repository for the Veins part of the Plexe simulator. Please see the official [website](http://plexe.car2x.org) for the documentation.
